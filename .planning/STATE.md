## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:
- [Phase 01-dark-theme-foundation]: Preserve original saturation (100%) to maintain Poimandres aesthetic — Base color #00CED1 has 100% saturation; reducing to 75% would alter aesthetic character
- [Phase 01-dark-theme-foundation]: Use 11% minimum lightness for darkest shade — Provides better contrast while maintaining visual hierarchy
- [Phase 01-dark-theme-foundation]: Minimum 10% lightness difference between adjacent shades — Validation requirement for visual distinction; ensures palette hierarchy is perceptible
- [Phase 01-dark-theme-foundation]: Dark mode only: Apply extended turquoise palette to dark mode only, preserving light mode unchanged — Maintains compatibility with existing light mode usage while providing expanded palette in dark mode
- [Phase 01-dark-theme-foundation]: Semantic mapping updates: Replace specific mint/turquoise colors in dark mode with expanded palette — Provides finer granularity of turquoise shades in dark mode while preserving original aesthetic
